      <h2>Cancellations and No-Shows</h2>
      <p>
        In the event that you need to change or cancel your dogâ€™s spa
        appointment we require 48 hours notice. Late cancellations will result
        in a $50 + GST no-show charge, which must be paid in order to book a
        future grooming appointment with us.
